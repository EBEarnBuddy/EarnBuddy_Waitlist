# 🧠 EarnBuddy — Build. Earn. Grow. Together.

Welcome to EarnBuddy — a platform built for GenZ students, freelancers, and startup aspirants who want to grow faster by connecting with the right people, ideas, and opportunities.

## 🚀 What is EarnBuddy?

EarnBuddy is a community-driven platform where:

* 🎯 Startup builders find reliable collaborators and early team members
* 💼 Freelancers co-work on bigger gigs to earn better and deliver faster
* 📚 Students break into real-world opportunities, even with zero experience
* 🌐 Curated pods help you network, learn, and grow with like-minded peers

We’re solving the “I have talent, but no access” problem.

## 🔑 Key Features (in progress)

* ✅ Team/Co-founder matching for early-stage startups
* ✅ Smart gig-sharing for freelancers (colancing model)
* ✅ “Starter gigs” for students with no experience
* ✅ Personalized community pods based on your goals and skills
* ✅ Skill-based reputation and collaboration history
* ✅ Access to mentorship, feedback, and beta communities

## 🧪 Why We’re Building This

Too many great ideas die because of:
